Overview
This project aims to demonstrate various data analysis and visualization techniques using Python. It includes three main files:

find_places.py: This script extracts data from external APIs and saves it locally. We then look for restaurants in NYC.
get_place_details.py: This script gathers details on reviews for different places in Google Maps.
metric_visualizations.py: This script generates visualizations for numerical, time series, and categorical data.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python packages: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-project.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd data-analysis-project

Install the required Python packages:
pip install: requests, pandas, json, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Usage
Ensure you have your data file (your_data.csv) in the project directory.

Run the data_extraction.py script to extract data from external APIs and save it locally:
python find_places.py

Once the data is extracted, run the metric_visualizations.py script to generate visualizations:
python metric_visualizations.py

Files
find_places.py: Python script for extracting data from external APIs.
