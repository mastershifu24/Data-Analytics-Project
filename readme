# Metric Visualizations

## Overview
This script generates various visualizations to provide insights into the dataset. The visualizations include histograms, line plots, and bar plots. Each plot helps to understand different aspects of the data.

## Figures and Numbers

### 1. Distribution of Numerical Column
![Histogram of Numerical Column](histogram_numerical_column.png)

The histogram shows the distribution of values in the 'numerical_column'. It highlights the frequency of different value ranges and helps identify the central tendency, spread, and skewness of the data.

### 2. Time Series of Value Column

The line plot illustrates the trend of 'value_column' over time. It helps identify trends, seasonal patterns, or anomalies by showing the variation of values across different dates.

### 3. Frequency of Categories in Categorical Column

The bar plot displays the frequency distribution of categories in the 'categorical_column'. It provides a clear visual comparison of the relative frequency of each category.

## Conclusion
These visualizations offer valuable insights into the dataset, aiding in data analysis and decision-making processes. By examining the distributions, trends, and frequencies, we can better understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.
